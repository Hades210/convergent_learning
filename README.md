## Assemble prerequisites

Several dependencies should be installed.

 * To run experiments: [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and its relevant dependencies (see [install tutorial](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)).
 * To produce plots: the IPython, numpy, and matplotlib packages for python. Depending on your setup, it may be possible to install these via `pip install ipython numpy matplotlib`.
